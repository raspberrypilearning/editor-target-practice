Comment out the line to print the ðŸŽ¯ character.

Display a message **if** the `hit_colour`{:.language-python} is equal to the `outer` circle colour (blue) ðŸŽ¯. 

Notice that the code uses two equals signs `==`{:.language-python} to mean **equal to**.

### Debugging

Make sure your code matches exactly and you have indented the code inside your `if` statement. 

If you changed the colour of your outer circle, you will need to replace `'blue'` with the name of the colour you have chosen.
